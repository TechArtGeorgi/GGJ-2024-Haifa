# Description
The game is about a kid who was sent to spend the weekend with his Old Grumpy Grampa. 
You, as the player, need to cheer the kid up by planting various pranks around the house to prank the grandpa in order to make the kid laugh. 
Like every good prank, timing is the key to success. Click on the various objects around the house to make the grandpa interact with them and set your traps when he's not looking. Happy pranking :)
